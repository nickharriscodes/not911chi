I had this idea today to create an album of 1 minute songs. I was listening to the audiobook “How to Do Nothing” by Jenny O’Dell, which in part centers on the way that the “attention economy” (brought about by new media/social media on the internet) intentionally fries users’ ability to deeply focus and be present. Modern attention spans are completely shot. So I thought, why not create a piece of music that reflects that reality in its form? A frenzied series of 1 minute recordings which never really provided a deep sense of satisfaction, just momentary stimulation, and then on to the next thing. Good way to get back into the habit of writing music too. Later, I remembered Tierra Whack’s amazing album from last year that is essentially the exact same idea, and is more directly focused on working within the stringent boundaries that Instagram specifically places on video — 1 minute maximum duration. Everything's been done, hasn't it? (I don't really believe that - was just thinking the other day about the infinite potentiality of music) Still, I think it would be worth experimenting with, whether I end up sharing the music or not.
