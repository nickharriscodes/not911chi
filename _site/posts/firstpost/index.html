      <h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>Lately, and for a while now, scrolling through social media I get the feeling that I have a worm in my brain with its slimy body wrapped around the controls, forcing me to continue scrolling, reading the next bit of new content, most of it designed to inflict some level of instant emotional response or hit of dopamine, which I imagine to be the main sustenance of this invertebrate. Why? Because even though I know at my core I’m in no way benefiting from this activity (and often times in fact I’m negatively affected), I can’t stop scrolling, taking in more content, and marinating in the brain chemicals, whatever emotions and feelings that are triggered in me. It’s like watching a car accident and being unable to look away, except I’m also seeing my friends, family, and random acquaintances comment and share their own (sometimes insightful, but often poorly thought through, occasionally offensive and disappointing) thoughts on the crash.</p>
<p>I suppose the brain worm is part of the impetus of my starting this blog. Writing out my thoughts, observations, opinions, etc very deliberately in a longer form like this has sort of the opposite affect on me that scrolling through short, triggering posts and comment threads has. It can be profoundly calming and provides some clarity and perspective. I wanted a space on the web to post my thoughts about what’s going on in my life and in the world that’s not tied to any brain worm-breeding personal information-harvesting (that’s a post for another day) platform. So here I am.</p>
<p>And that's not the only reason I'm here, writing this. But I'll get to the others another day.</p>
