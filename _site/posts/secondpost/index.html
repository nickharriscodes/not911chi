      <h1>Fungus is Cool</h1>

<p>It draws its life from dead organic matter, and in doing so, helps along the process of converting that matter back into the earth to be eventually be reformed, perhaps again as a living organic matter. That is a pretty profound and potentially symbolic role to play in the world of living things, and is arguably the link that forms what is often thought of as “the circle of life” (cue Elton John). This may be a stretch, but I think the act of writing, perhaps some other art forms too, is the fungus of thoughts, the fungus of experience. Experiences, thoughts are fleeting and occur in a specific moment and then are gone, or dead. They become memory instantaneously after they occur, and writing can grow out of these memories of fleeting moments, making sense of them and clearing the way for new thoughts and experiences to occur.</p>
